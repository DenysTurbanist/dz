    <dt><p><b>ACT 1</b></p></dt>

   <dt> <p><b>Prologue</b></p></dt>

    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity,
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
        Where civil blood makes civil hands <br> unclean.
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers <br>take their life;
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
        Do with their death bury <br>their parents' strife.
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
        And the <br>continuance of their parents' rage,
        Which, but their children's end, nought could <br> remove,
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
        The which if you with patient <br> ears attend,
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>

        <dt><p><b>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</b></p></dt>

        <p>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>

        <dt><p><b>SAMPSON</b></p></dt>

        <P>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</P>

        <dt><P><b>GREGORY</b></P></dt>

        <P>No, for then we should be colliers.</P>
